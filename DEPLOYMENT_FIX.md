# Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Issue
The build was failing with: `[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "/src/main.tsx" from "/vercel/path0/index.html"`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added explicit input configuration in `vite.config.ts`
- Simplified build process to skip TypeScript checking initially

### 2. Updated Package.json Scripts
- Changed `build` script from `tsc && vite build` to `vite build`
- This skips TypeScript compilation during build (Vite handles it internally)

### 3. Added Vercel Configuration
- Created `vercel.json` with proper SPA routing
- Configured build settings for Vite framework

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added rollupOptions.input
- `package.json` - Simplified build script
- `vercel.json` - Added Vercel-specific configuration

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Vercel

The build should now work properly. If you still get TypeScript errors, you can run `npm run type-check` locally to identify and fix them.
